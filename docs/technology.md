AetherLink OS Architecture

AetherLink combines three modular technologies designed for privacy, reliability, and synchronization:

Component: 

ZK-Aura:                      A zero-knowledge balance proof protocol ensuring transaction legitimacy without identity exposure.
LumenMesh:	                  A lightweight peer-to-peer mesh network enabling offline verification and sync when devices reconnect.
A402 Signature Layer:	        An advanced cryptographic layer inspired by x402, ensuring synchronization integrity with the main chain.

⚙️ Operation Modes

Offline First: Transactions occur directly between devices using NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Online Sync: Once devices reconnect, transactions are anchored to the AetherLink ledger, maintaining verifiable global consensus.
